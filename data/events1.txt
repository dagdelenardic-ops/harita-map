The Great Depression in 1930
It was on December 2 1930 that President Herbert Hoover addressed a State of the Union to make awareness of America’s economic situation. Following the Wall Street Crash and the beginning of the Great Depression, the US economy was suffering desperately and it was time for the government to act upon this, despite always having a laissez-faire approach to economic affairs.
Despite claiming that “Substantial progress has been made during the year in national peace and security,” the US and the rest of the world would continue to face challenges with lack of jobs, unemployment and homelessness. Hoover would then ask the government for a $150 million public works program to provide jobs for the unemployed and eventual stimulate the economy. This was a big change to the American government and went against Hoover’s initial beliefs that the economy would be able to sort itself out without any intervention.

The Salt March in India
The Salt March took place in India from March 12 to 6 April 1930 and was led by Mahatma Gandhi. The march was an act of civil disobedience in order to protest British rule in India. Thousands of Indians followed Gandhi from his retreat near Ahmedabad to the Arabian Sea Coast, marching around 240 miles. Nearly 60,000 people were arrested, including Gandhi.
The march was immediately responding to Britain’s Salt Act of 1882, which restricted Indians from collecting or selling salt. The mineral was a staple of Indian diets, and they were forced to collect salt directly from their British rulers. In turn, Britain charged a heavy salt tax, which made acquiring salt expensive and more difficult for the people of India. While poor people in India struggled under most taxes, the salt tax was affecting something fundamental to their food.
The march did have a degree of success, contributing to the eventual independence granted to India in 1947. In 1931, Gandhi was released from prison and he traveled to London for a conference to discuss matters. While Gandhi didn’t achieve immediate success from the conference, it became quickly apparent that British leaders were unable to avoid his force.



Key Events of 1962
The Cuban Missile Crisis Pushes the World to the Brink
IN OCTOBER 1962, the discovery of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba brought the world closer to nuclear war than ever before. Following U.S. reconnaissance flights on 14 October, President Kennedy announced a naval blockade on 22 October and demanded immediate removal of the weapons. After 13 tense days, Soviet Premier Khrushchev agreed to withdraw the missiles in exchange for U.S. assurances not to invade Cuba and a secret pledge to remove American missiles from Turkey. The crisis was a defining Cold War moment, prompting the establishment of a direct Washington – Moscow hotline and shifting global diplomacy.
The British Empire Continues Its Retreat
1962 WAS a landmark year in the decolonisation of the British Empire. Jamaica (6 August) and Trinidad and Tobago (31 August) both achieved independence, followed by Uganda (9 October) in East Africa. These peaceful transitions reflected Britain’s shifting role on the global stage and the rise of sovereign nations across the Commonwealth. As colonial rule gave way to self-governance, a new post-imperial era emerged, reshaping Britain’s international relationships.
Key Events of 1967
The Six-Day War and Its Global Impact
IN JUNE 1967, tensions between Israel and its Arab neighbours culminated in the Six-Day War, one of the most significant conflicts in post-WWII geopolitics. Israel’s rapid military success led to its occupation of the Gaza Strip, West Bank, East Jerusalem, Golan Heights, and Sinai Peninsula. These territorial changes redrew the map of the Middle East and initiated long-term disputes over land, sovereignty, and identity. The war also triggered a global refugee crisis and remains at the heart of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict today.
The Summer of Love and Cultural Revolution
1967 WAS the apex of the counterculture movement, especially visible during the “Summer of Love” in San Francisco and mirrored in the UK and Europe. Music, art, drug experimentation, and protests against the Vietnam War defined youth culture. The release of The Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band symbolised this shift. Events like the Monterey Pop Festival and the rise of psychedelic rock pointed to a broader societal transformation, a rebellion against conformity, war, and materialism.
Legal Reform in Britain
THE UK made significant strides in progressive legislation during 1967. The Sexual Offences Act partially decriminalised homosexuality between consenting men over 21 in private in England and Wales. Later that year, the Abortion Act legalised abortion under specific conditions. Both Acts were landmark moments for civil life in Britain. They reflected the changing moral landscape of the 1960s and established the groundwork for future reforms in gender and sexual rights.

The General Strike
The biggest event in Britain in 1926 was undoubtedly the General Strike, which saw the Trades Union Congress attempt to prevent mine owners from reducing their workers’ pay. Interestingly, a large-scale strike had been spiritually preempted by a BBC radio play in January of the same year, which had caused mass panic as many listeners failed to realise that the broadcast, which depicted a workers’ revolution in London, was simply satire.
On March 10, the Samuel Commission published a report recommending the nationalisation of the mining industry and a 13.5% decrease in workers’ wages. The British government announced that they would accept said terms. Mine owners also declared their intention of lengthening working hours.
After failing to reach an agreement in negotiations, the TUC announced a strike beginning at a minute to midnight on May 3. The following day, 1.7 million workers from every corner of the country went on strike in support of coal miners. Public transport came to a halt and newspapers ceased printing, amongst other disruptions. On May 9, the government enforced martial law.
After failing to have their demands met, the TUC officially called off the strike on May 12, rendering it unsuccessful. Many continued striking for months afterwards, but by November, most miners were back at work, for more hours, and less money.

Who Were the Biggest Celebrities in 1926?
Celebrities in 1926, regardless of their industry, are forever entwined with the culture of the roaring twenties, and all the cars, jazz, flappers, dancing and art deco that came with it.
The twenties are one of the most distinguishable decades for fashion, so it comes as no surprise that one of the most famous women of the time was Coco Chanel. In 1926, Vogue published an iconic image of Chanel, then in her mid-forties, sporting what would become known as the “garçonne” look. By 1926, America was deep into the prohibition era, which ironically saw a boom for many a notorious nightspot, many of which were overseen by Chicago mob boss Al Capone. Some other famous faces in pop culture at the time include author F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda (dubbed the first American flapper), Cotton Club bandleader Duke Ellington, and French-American entertainer Josephine Baker.

1926 was the last year Hollywood was still dominated by silent film stars, as the first “talkie”, The Jazz Singer, was released the following year and brought about the end of the silent era. Amongst the biggest film stars in 1926 were Douglas Fairbanks (known to audiences as both Zorro and Robin Hood), Gloria Swanson, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, “Queen of the Movies” Mary Pickford, Joan Crawford and brothers John and Lionel Barrymore. 1926 also saw the American debut of Swedish starlet Greta Garbo, and the untimely death of Italian heartthrob Rudolph Valentino.
North American sports pages in 1926 were often dominated by baseball players such as Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth. Heavyweight Champion Jack Dempsey was also a huge star, at least before his shock defeat to Gene Tunney in 1926. Across the Atlantic, manager Herbert Chapman was the biggest name in association football after turning Huddersfield and then Arsenal into the best team in the country. American Bobby Jones helped to popularise the sport of golf in his home country after victories in both the British Open and the US Open in 1926.
